### Restart Kde
Need to restart kde(re-login) after **updating plugin** or **reinstalling plugin lib**  
Or try: `kquitapp5 plasmashell && kstart5 plasmashell`  

## Support Status
### Scene
Scene wallpaper is supported by direct opengl(3.2).  
It's almost usable.  
#### not work
- 3D model
- Timeline animations
- Puppet warp
- Scene script  
- Text layer  
- Audio visualization
- Camera shake,fade,path,~~zoom,parallax~~
- Global bloom effect  
- ~~Playing audio~~
- ~~PBR light~~
- ~~Perspective renderable~~  
- ~~Particle System~~  
- ~~Gif scene~~
- ~~ColorBlendMode~~  

### Web
Basic web apis are supported, but the audio api dose not send data at now.  
#### no webgl
WebEngineView in plasmashell can't init opengl.  
Some wallpaper using webgl may not work, and performance may be bad.   

### Video HWdecode  
#### QtMultimedia
Default video backend of this plugin.  
It's using GStreamer to play video.  
To enable hwdecode:  
- GStreamer plugin installed
like `gstreamer1.0-vaapi` in debain
- `GST_VAAPI_ALL_DRIVERS=1`
this needed for vaapi  
put it to where the xserver read.  

#### Mpv
Need to compile plugin lib.  
The config is set to `hwdec=auto`, and not configurable at now.
